`Computer Science Student(Sales/Development/Management)`

I am a computer science student at the University of Toronto. I am extremely passionate about programming and enjoy building interesting and confusing projects. That being said, my expertise is in Algorithm development and the Maths side of programming. I try to build efficient and effective projects and am always looking to learn as much as I possibly can. I would not describe myself as a great programmer(yet), but rather as an extremely fast and eager learner. Anything I decide to learn, I am able to completely understand quickly and efficiently.
